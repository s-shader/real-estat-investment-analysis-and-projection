## Maximizing return via timeseries modeling 

# Scenario:
### As an analyst for a real estate investment company I am tasked with coming up with finding US zipcodes to invest in using time series modeling to predict future prices.

# Data:
### CSV table of almost 15,000 us zipcodes and their median home prices from 1996-2018
### Each zipcode contains, in addition to historical prices: it's city, state, metro area, county, and size rank
